Description: RNA Centric Annotation System is an automated system that provides
    dynamic annotations for custom input files that contain transcriptomic target
    regions. Such transcriptomic target regions could be, for instance, peak regions
    detected by CLIP-Seq analysis that detect protein-RNA interactions, MeRIP-Seq
    analysis that detect RNA modifications (alias the epitranscriptome), or any
    collection of target regions at the level of the transcriptome. RCAS contains
    wrapper functions to do de novo motif discovery using functions from the motifRG
    package. RCAS overlays the input target regions with the annotated protein-
    coding genes and calculates the Gene Ontology (GO) terms that may be enriched or
    depleted in the input target regions compared to the background list of protein-
    coding genes. A Classical Fisher's Exact Test is applied for each GO term and
    the p-values obtained for each GO term is corrected for multiple testing using
    both the False Discovery Rate and the Family-Wise Error Rate. Similarly to the
    GO term enrichment analysis, RCAS also detects sets of genes as annotated in
    the Molecular Signatures Database that are enriched or depleted in the queried
    target regions. Results are corrected for multiple-testing according to both the
    False Discovery Rate and the Family-Wise Error Rate.
