Description: RCAS is an R/Bioconductor package designed as a generic reporting tool for the
    functional analysis of transcriptome-wide regions of interest detected by
    high-throughput experiments. Such transcriptomic regions could be, for instance,
    signal peaks detected by CLIP-Seq analysis for protein-RNA interaction sites,
    RNA modification sites (alias the epitranscriptome), CAGE-tag locations, or any
    other collection of query regions at the level of the transcriptome. RCAS
    produces in-depth annotation summaries and coverage profiles based on the
    distribution of the query regions with respect to transcript features (exons,
    introns, 5'/3' UTR regions, exon-intron boundaries, promoter regions). Moreover,
    RCAS can carry out functional enrichment analyses and discriminative motif
    discovery.
