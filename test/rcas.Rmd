# Summary Figures

------

## Distribution of query regions across gene features
**Figure `r figure_count`:** The number of query regions that overlap different kinds of gene features are counted. The 'y' axis denotes the types of gene features included in the analysis and the 'x' axis denotes the percentage of query regions (out of total number of query regions denoted with "n") that overlap at least one genomic interval that host the corresponding feature. Notice that the sum of the percentage values for different features don't add up to 100%, because some query regions may overlap multiple kinds of features. If the query regions don't overlap any gene features, they are classified as "intergenic". 
```{r distri_gene_features, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dt = mdata
df = dt[,length(unique(peak_id)), by=feature]
colnames(df) = c("feature", "count")
df = df[order(count)]
df$percent = round(df$count / length(unique(dt$peak_id)) * 100, 1)

The 'y' axis denotes the types of gene features included in the analysis and the 'x' axis denotes the percentage of query regions (out of total number of query regions denoted with "n") that overlap at least one genomic interval that host the corresponding RNA gene type. Notice that the sum of the percentage values for different RNA genes don't add up to 100%, because some query regions may overlap multiple kinds of RNA genes.

## Distribution of query regions in the genome grouped by gene types 
**Figure `r figure_count`:** The number of query regions that overlap different kinds of gene types are counted. The 'x' axis denotes the types of genes included in the analysis and the 'y' axis denotes the percentage of query regions (out of total number of query regions denoted with "n") that overlap at least one genomic interval that host the corresponding gene type.

## Distribution of query regions across the chromosomes grouped by gene features 
**Figure `r figure_count`:** The number of query regions that overlap different chromosomes are counted. For each chromosome, the frequency of query regions are further split into groups based on the gene features the query overlaps with. The 'x' axis denotes the chromosomes included in the analysis and the 'y' axis denotes the frequency of overlaps.

## Coverage profile of query regions across the length of transcripts
**Figure `r figure_count`:** The query regions are overlaid with the genomic coordinates of transcripts. The transcripts are divided into 100 bins of equal length and for each bin the number of query regions that cover the corresponding bin is counted. Transcripts shorter than 100bp are excluded. Thus, a coverage profile of the transcripts is obtained based on the distribution of the query regions. The strandedness of the transcripts are taken into account. The coverage profile is plotted in the 5' to 3' direction. 
```{r coverage_transcript, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
calculate_coverage (peaks, windows = transcripts(txdb), "transcripts") 
figure_count = figure_count + 1
```

## Coverage profile of query regions across the length of Exons
**Figure `r figure_count`:** The query regions are overlaid with the genomic coordinates of each exon of each transcript. The exons are divided into 100 bins of equal length and for each bin the number of query regions that cover the corresponding bin is counted. Exons shorter than 100bp are excluded. Thus, a coverage profile of the exons is obtained based on the distribution of the query regions. The strandedness of the exons are taken into account. The coverage profile is plotted in the 5' to 3' direction. 
```{r coverage_exon, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

```

## Coverage profile of query regions across the 100 bp region centered on exon-intron junctions
**Figure `r figure_count`:** The query regions are overlaid with the genomic coordinates of each exon-intron junction of each transcript. The junction comprises of a 50 bp region of an exon and 50 bp region of its neighboring intron. Exon-intron junctions are divided into 100 bins of equal length and for each bin the number of query regions that cover the corresponding bin is counted. Exons shorter than 100bp are excluded. Thus, a coverage profile of the exon-intron junctions is obtained based on the distribution of the query regions. The strandedness of the exons are taken into account. The coverage profile is plotted in the 5' to 3' direction. 
```{r coverage_exon-intron, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
myexons = exons[width(exons) > 100] #remove exons that are shorter than 100 bp
up_exon = flank(myexons, 50, start=TRUE, both=TRUE) #50 bp from upstream intron 50 bp from exon 
down_exon = flank(myexons, 50, start=FALSE, both=TRUE) #50 bp from downstream intron, 50 bp from exon
exon_intron_junctions = c(up_exon, down_exon)

```

## Coverage profile of query regions across the length of introns
**Figure `r figure_count`:** The query regions are overlaid with the genomic coordinates of each intron of each transcript. The introns are divided into 100 bins of equal length and for each bin the number of query regions that cover the corresponding bin is counted. Introns shorter than 100bp are excluded. Thus, a coverage profile of the introns is obtained based on the distribution of the query regions. The strandedness of the introns are taken into account. The coverage profile is plotted in the 5' to 3' direction. 
```{r coverage_intron, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
introns = unlist(intronsByTranscript(txdb))
calculate_coverage (peaks, windows = introns, "introns")
figure_count = figure_count + 1
```

## Coverage profile of query regions across the promoter regions
**Figure `r figure_count`:** The query regions are overlaid with the genomic coordinates of each promoter region of each transcript. The promoter region is defined as the region spanning from 2000bp upstream of the transcription start site and the first 200bp region after the transcription start site. The promoters are divided into 100 bins of equal length and for each bin the number of query regions that cover the corresponding bin is counted. Thus, a coverage profile of the promoters is obtained based on the distribution of the query regions. The strandedness of the promoters are taken into account. The coverage profile is plotted in the 5' to 3' direction. 
```{r coverage_promoter, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

The 5' UTR regions are divided into 100 bins of equal length and for each bin the number of query regions that cover the corresponding bin is counted. Thus, a coverage profile of the 5' UTR regions is obtained based on the distribution of the query regions. The strandedness of the promoters are taken into account. The coverage profile is plotted in the 5' to 3' direction. 
```{r coverage_UTR5, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
five_UTRs = unlist(fiveUTRsByTranscript(txdb))
calculate_coverage (peaks, windows = five_UTRs, "5' UTRs")

```

## Coverage profile of query regions across the length of 3' UTRs
**Figure `r figure_count`:** The query regions are overlaid with the genomic coordinates of each 3' UTR region of each transcript. The 3' UTR regions are divided into 100 bins of equal length and for each bin the number of query regions that cover the corresponding bin is counted. Thus, a coverage profile of the 3' UTR regions is obtained based on the distribution of the query regions. The strandedness of the promoters are taken into account. The coverage profile is plotted in the 5' to 3' direction. 
```{r coverage_UTR3, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
